👋 Hi, I’m Pathum Kossinna and I'm a bioinformatician/data scientist. I'm currently a Graduate Assisitant in the Long and Zhang Labs at the University of Calgary.

👀 I’m interested in machine learning, data science, bioinformatics, new technologies and tools. I'm also an avid reader, both of books (HP⚡!) and articles.

🌱 I’m currently learning more computer science (algorithms and data structures) and machine learning frameworks.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting data science or bioinformatics projects.
